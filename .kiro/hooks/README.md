# Agent Hooks

This directory contains agent hooks that trigger automatic executions based on events.

## What are Hooks?

Hooks allow Kiro to automatically execute tasks when specific events occur in your IDE.

## Examples

- Auto-run tests when you save a file
- Update translations when strings change
- Format code on save
- Generate documentation on file changes

## Creating Hooks

You can create hooks using:
- The Explorer view 'Agent Hooks' section
- Command Palette: 'Open Kiro Hook UI'

## Hook Types

- **File Save**: Triggered when files are saved
- **Manual**: Triggered by clicking a button
- **File Change**: Triggered when files are modified
